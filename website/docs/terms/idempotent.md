### What is idempotent?

Idempotent is a way to describe a particular process.  A process that is idempotent is independent of previous executions of that same process.  For a mathematical example, the process of adding 1 is not idempotent where as the process of multiplying by 1 is idempotent.  If I add 1 to a number and then add 1 again, I donâ€™t get the same results. If I multiply a number by 1 and multiply by 1 again, I do get the same result.
