The specific kind of database object that data is persisted as in a data warehouse. Its the manner in which the data is represented, and each of those options is defined either canonically (tables, views, incremental), or bespoke. 

We all know what a materialization is, but we want to be careful about describing the right part of this whole thing as "a materialization"
