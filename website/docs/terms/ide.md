IDE stand for "integrated development environment" - essentially, it’s an application that allows programmers to write & test code within a single graphical user interface. It’s a text editor (you can modify / create / delete new files); it’s a runner (you can execute dbt run to build tables and views in your data warehouse); it’s a compiler (you can easily see your "dbt" code compiled to raw sql); it’s a tester (you can preview your queries or execute dbt test to check the functionality of your new code); it’s version controlled (you can switch between branches, commit changes, open pull requests, etc.); oh my! The IDE is the cloud equivalent of software like Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc..
