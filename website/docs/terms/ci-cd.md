It’s a matter of personal taste whether you go with Continuous Deployment or Continuous Delivery. The former is for folks that want to integrate changes ASAP while the latter is for folks interested in shipping groups of changes at once. If you are using Continuous Integration, be on the look out for Slim CI so that you can save compute costs when testing changes.
