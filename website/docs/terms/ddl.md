DDL (Data Definition Language) defines the actual schema or structure of database objects (usually tables and views).  It creates / drops the actual database objects themselves (tables and views), but doesn’t pull data from or put data into those objects (that’s what DML does).

### Yelp review

I personally have gotten away with almost never writing DDL in my career, bc as an analyst generally I’ve been writing DML to just access data.  When I’ve tried to write it, it’s confusing + high stakes (hold up, drop a whole table?), and generally I’ve found it easier to perform DDL operations through a SQL browser than through writing actual DDL.
