title: How do I do X? How do I solve Y problem? Where can I go to get help?

First, please check the relevant documentation and FAQs. Also, search for answers using your favorite search engine and in [Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com/).

If you canâ€™t find an answer, please take a few minutes to consider which of these buckets your question falls into:
- "I'm hitting an error that I can't debug" â€” please post this to Stack Overflow with the tag `dbt`. By posting it on Stack Overflow, anyone else facing the same problem will be able to find this in the future.
- "I want input on a problem I'm trying to solve" â€” please join our [Slack community](http://community.getdbt.com/) and ask it in the correct channel.

In both cases, spend the time to formulate your question well. Explaining the problems you are facing clearly will help others help you. See our guide on [asking good questions](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-dbt-slack/290).

Please note that going forward, we are reserving [Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com/) as a place for users to share the tactics that have worked for them.

If you need dedicated support with building your dbt project, also consider engaging one of our [consulting partners](https://www.getdbt.com/ecosystem/).

**Note:** If you are a **dbt Cloud user** and need help with one of the following issues, please reach out to us by using the speech bubble (ðŸ’¬) in the dbt Cloud interface.
- Account setup (e.g. connection issues, repo connections)
- Billing
- Bug reports related to the web interface

As a rule of thumb, if you are using dbt Cloud, but your problem is related to code within your dbt project, then please follow the above process rather than reaching out to support.
