### Overview

If you are on the `Team` or `Enterprise` dbt Cloud plan, you will have access to the 
dbt Cloud API.

The dbt Cloud API can be used to:

- Download artifacts after a job has completed 
- Kick off a job run from an orchestration tool
- Manage your dbt Cloud account

Our API endpoints can be found [here](/dbt-cloud/api).

### How to Access the API 

#### User API tokens
You can find your API token in your user's profile under `API Access`.
