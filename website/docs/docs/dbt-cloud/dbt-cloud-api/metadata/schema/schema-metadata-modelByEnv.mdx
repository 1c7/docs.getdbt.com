This model by environment object allows you to query information about a particular model based on environmentId.

<ArgsTable queryName="modelByEnvironment" />

Below we show some illustrative example queries and outline the schema (all possible fields you can query) of this modelByEnvironment object.

### Example Query

Given an `environment_id` and `model_unique_id`, return the model and its execution time for the last 10 times it was run, regardless of which job ran it!

```graphql
{
  modelByEnvironment(
    environmentId: 1,
    uniqueId:"model.jaffle_shop.dim_user",
    lastRunCount:10,
    withCatalog: false
  ){
    uniqueId
    jobId,
    runId,
    executionTime
  }
}
```

### Fields

<SchemaTable nodeName="ModelNode" />
