This section provides an overview of the various deployment types available for dbt Cloud.

:::

In general, the dbt Cloud application deployment models fall into two categories: **hosted** and **customer managed**.

**Hosted** deployments are those that are hosted on infrastructure managed by Fishtown Analytics. The deployments in this category include _Production_ and _Single Tenant_. Both hosted models leverage AWS infrastructure as described in the [Architecture](deployment-architecture) section.

**Customer managed** deployments are configured and managed by the customer. The deployments in this category include _On-premise_ and _Airgapped_. The [Kubernetes Off-The-Shelf (KOTS)](https://kots.io/) software distributed by [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/) is leveraged to facilitate the management of deploying and upgrading dbt Cloud in customer managed environments.
