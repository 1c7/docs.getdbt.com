##TODO write a section about how users interact with adapters in Core and Cloud

## dbt Labs- and vendor-supported adapters

##TODO say all adapters are available on dbt Core by default

Learn how to use one of these adapters:

* [Apache Spark](/docs/connecting-to-dbt/using-your-adapter/apache-spark-adapter): dbt Labs-supported and available in dbt Cloud
* [BigQuery](/docs/connecting-to-dbt/using-your-adapter/bigquery-adapter): dbt Labs-supported and available in dbt Cloud
* [Databricks](/docs/connecting-to-dbt/using-your-adapter/databricks-adapter): dbt Labs-supported and available in dbt Cloud
* [Firebolt](/docs/connecting-to-dbt/using-your-adapter-firebolt-adapter): vendor-supported and available in dbt Cloud

## Community-supported adapters

You can use community-supported adapters in dbt Core, but not dbt Cloud (yet). These adapters are supported and maintained by members of the dbt community, so they are works in progress. You can contribute to adapter support by testing, writing code, or even updating their docs! 

Learn more about contributing:

* Join the dedicated channel in dbt Slack. For example, `#db-sqlserver` or `#db-athena`.
* Check out the open issues in the adapter's source repository.
