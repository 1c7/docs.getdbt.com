## Using adapters in dbt Core and dbt Cloud

As noted in [Connecting to dbt](docs/connecting-to-dbt/connecting-to-dbt), all adapters are available on dbt Core. If there is an adapter you would like to be in dbt Cloud, contact Support (support@getdbt.com) to let us know.

All adapters on open source, so if you have an idea or found an bug on the adapters, please do contribute! 

Ways to contribute: 

* Join the dedicated channel in dbt Slack listed on the adapter landing page. For example, `#db-sqlserver` or `#db-athena`.
* Check out the open issues in the adapter's source repository.
* Open Pull Requests for any new features or bug fixes.
