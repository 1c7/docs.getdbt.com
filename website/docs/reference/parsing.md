## What is parsing?

At the start of every dbt invocation, dbt reads all the files in your project, extracts information, and constructs a manifest containing every object (model, source, macro, etc). For instance, dbt uses the `ref()`, `source()`, and `config()` macro calls within models to infer dependencies and construct your project's DAG.

Parsing projects can be slow, especially as projects get biggerâ€”say, more than 500 models. There are three performance optimizations that dbt offers today, to speed up parsing:
- Partial parsing, to avoid re-parsing unchanged files in development
- An experimental parser, to parse simple models more quickly
- [RPC server](rpc), which parses the project at server startup/hangup and keeps a manifest in memory

## Partial parsing

After parsing your project, dbt stores an internal project manifest in a file called `partial_parse.msgpack`. When partial parsing is enabled, dbt will use that internal manifest to determine which files have been changed (if any) since it last parsed the project. Then, it will _only_ parse the changed files, or files related those changes.

Partial parsing is off by default, and it can be enabled via [profile config](profiles.yml#partial_parse) or [CLI flags](global-cli-flags#partial-parsing). In development, partial parsing can reduce the time spent waiting at the start of a run by more than 90%, which translates to faster dev cycles and iteration.

### Known limitations

Use caution when enabling partial parsing in dbt, as there are known limitations today:
- A change in environment variables does not trigger a re-parse. Files which depend on [`env_var`](env_var) may be incorrect on subsequent parses.
- Changes to macros called within a model's `config()` block will not result in re-parsing that model.
- A file that depends on "volatile" Jinja variables, such as [`run_started_at`](run_started_at) or [`invocation_id`](invocation_id), will quickly get stale. A file is not re-parsed in subsequent invocations if the file's contents have not changed.
- If certain inputs change between runs, dbt will trigger a full re-parse. Today those inputs are:
    - `--vars`
    - `profiles.yml` content
    - `dbt_project.yml` content
    - installed packages
    - dbt version

## Experimental parser

At parse time, dbt needs to extract the contents of `ref()`, `source()`, and `config()` from all models in the project. Traditionally, dbt has extracted those values by rendering the Jinja in every model file, which can be slow. In v0.20.0, we're trying out a new way to statically analyze model files, leveraging [`tree-sitter`](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter), which we're calling an "experimental parser". You can see the code for an initial Jinja2 grammar here: https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/tree-sitter-jinja2.

For now, the experimental parser only works with models, and models whose Jinja is limited to those three special macros (`ref`, `source`, `config`). The experimental parser is at least 3x faster than a full Jinja render. Based on testing with data from dbt Cloud, we believe the current grammar can statically parse 60% of models in the wild. So for the average project, we'd hope to see a 40% speedup in the model parser. You can check this by running `dbt parse` and `dbt parse --use-experimental-parser`, and comparing `target/perf_info.json` produced by each.

The experimental parser is off by default. We believe it can offer *some* speedup to 95% of projects.

**Note:** Do not use the experimental parser if you've overridden the `ref`, `source`, or `config` macro with a custom implementation.
