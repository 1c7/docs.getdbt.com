# Can I set a different connection at the environment level?

Category: Environments, FAQ, Warehouse
Format: FAQ

Although you're unable to set a different connection at the environment level, there is a workaround where you can have separate projects for their different environments and link them to different hostnames, while still connecting to the same repo.

I'll pass on your feedback to our Product team as a feature request too, really appreciate it 🙏

Please let us know if you have any questions at all or clarifications, more than happy to help!
